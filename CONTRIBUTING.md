# How to contribute
We would love to have your help. Before you start working however, please read
and follow this short guide.

# Reporting Issues
Before you open an issue on GitHub, please discuss it on one of our
forum(https://vitalpbx.org/community) and wait for a 
confirmation from one of the committers. Once you have that confirmation, 
please proceed to reporting the issue on Github, while providing as much 
information as possible. Mention the version of VitalPBX Communicator you are using, your 
operating system and explain how the problem can be reproduced.

Please note that issues that are reported against a version older than the 
current stable release will be closed without further investigation. If you 
discover however that the issue also exists in an older version, this is 
useful information. Even more useful is to know if it worked in a specific 
version and stopped working in a subsequent version. This will help 
developers pinpoint the issue. Also useful is to test the nightly build.

# Translation
Please go to our [translation website](http://translate.vitalpbx.org), which is a
[Pootle](http://pootle.translatehouse.org/) instance that allows for easy
online translation. Many languages are already there and waiting for completion.

If your preferred language is not yet created, please drop us an
[e-mail](mailto:dev@vitalpbx.org). Be aware though that completing a new language
will be quite some effort, so be sure you actually want to take on that
work and translate more than a few words.

Please do not create any pull requests for the resources_XX.properties files,
as they will be overwritten with what comes from
[Pootle](http://translate.vitalpbx.org). The only exception is if you find
mistakes in the language file for
[English](https://github.com/VitalPBX/vitalpbxcommunicator/blob/master/resources/languages/resources.properties).
